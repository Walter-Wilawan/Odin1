    <ol>
        <li>Make small cuts all around the edges of the meat and into the meat overall, or use a meat tenderizer and bash lightly. This makes the meat less likely to curl and shrink up during cooking. Lightly season the meat with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Prepare three containers — with flour, beaten egg, and panko. Coat the meat in the flour first, then dip in the beaten egg and coat in the breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Prepare enough oil to completely immerse the cutlet and heat to 180°C/350°F. Put the cutlets in the oil for 30 seconds. Take the cutlets out, and let the oil cool down to 170°C/350°F. Remove any breadcrumbs from the oil. Fry the cutlets one at a time for about 2 to 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Drain and serve immediately. If the diners will be using chopsticks, slice the meat. Complete with raw shredded cabbage, a lemon wedge and tonkatsu sauce</li>
    </ol>
